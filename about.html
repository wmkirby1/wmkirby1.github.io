<p>CV available upon request.</p>
<p><em>Bio</em></p>
<p>I am a research scientist at IBM Quantum, focusing on design and analysis of quantum simulation algorithms for physical systems. I received my Ph.D. in Physics in 2023 from Tufts University, where I worked in <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tuftsqi/home">Peter Love's quantum computation group</a>, also focusing on quantum simulation, funded by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and the <a href="https://staq.pratt.duke.edu/">STAQ collaboration</a> (also courtesy of NSF). In the summers of 2021 and 2022, I worked as a research intern at IBM Quantum. In January of 2022, I designed and taught <a href="https://catalog.williams.edu/PHYS/detail/?cn=14&crsid=022014&strm=1222">PHYS 14 Programming Quantum Computers</a> at Williams College for winter study (January term). Previously, I received my B.A. in physics from Williams College in 2017. At Williams, I conducted research with <a href="https://sites.williams.edu/ion/">Charlie Doret</a> and <a href="http://physics.williams.edu/profile/wwootter/">Bill Wootters</a>, before completing a senior research thesis with <a href="http://sites.williams.edu/fws1/">Frederick Strauch</a>. In 2017-2018 I conducted research with <a href="http://shelbykimmel.com/">Shelby Kimmel</a> of Middlebury College on methods for calibrating quantum gate sets.</p>
<p>In addition to physics, I enjoy birdwatching, exploring new natural places, and running with my dog.</p>
